# Collector Watcher

Automation tool for watching and collecting OpenTelemetry Collector component metadata.

## Methodology

On a nightly basis, the tool scans the OpenTelemetry Collector core and contrib repositories to
detect any changes in component metadata.

Process:

- Clone or update local copies of the `core` and `contrib` collector repositories.
- Scan for components and parse their `metadata.yaml` files.
- Record each component's Go module path (from its own `go.mod`) and module version (from the
  repository's `versions.yaml`), which an OCB manifest needs. Module versions can differ from the
  release tag: for example, contrib's `stable-base` modules are released at v1.x.
- Create or update versioned snapshots of component metadata in YAML format.
- Store the upstream `metadata-schema.yaml` in content-addressed storage under
  `ecosystem-registry/collector/meta/schemas/{hash}.yaml`.
- Detect deprecations across versions and maintain the deprecation baseline in
  `ecosystem-registry/collector/deprecations.yaml`.

You can pass in a location of the repositories to scan via environment variables or else it will
default to cloning them into `tmp_repos/`.

It maintains a versioned `inventory` of component snapshots in YAML format in the
`ecosystem-registry/collector` directory, alongside the shared `deprecations.yaml` baseline and
`meta/schemas/` schema store at the `collector/` root.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can specify custom repository locations using environment variables:

- `OTEL_COLLECTOR_CORE_PATH` - Path to local opentelemetry-collector-core repository
- `OTEL_COLLECTOR_CONTRIB_PATH` - Path to local opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository

If not set, repositories will be automatically cloned to `tmp_repos/`.

## Usage

### Normal Sync Mode

From the repository root:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher
```

This will:

- Process the latest release version for each distribution (if not already tracked)
- Update the SNAPSHOT version from the main branch
- Skip component metadata processing for versions already in the inventory
- Retry missing `component-readmes.yaml` indexes for all tracked releases using their own tags.
  Completed indexes (including empty maps) are skipped; README write failures are logged and retried
  on the next run without rewriting component metadata or updating the deprecation baseline.

### Backfill Mode

Backfill mode allows you to regenerate existing versions in the inventory. This is useful when:

- Scanner logic changes (e.g., new component exclusions)
- Metadata parsing improvements are made
- You need to apply updates to historical data

#### Backfill All Versions

Regenerate all existing versions for all distributions:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher --backfill
```

#### Backfill Specific Distribution

Regenerate all versions for a single distribution:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher --backfill --distribution contrib
```

#### Backfill Specific Versions

Regenerate specific versions for a distribution:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher --backfill --distribution contrib --versions "0.144.0,0.145.0"
```

Apply a version list to all distributions:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher --backfill --versions "0.144.0,0.145.0"
```

#### Prune Unlisted Versions

Reduce the registry to exactly the listed versions — regenerate them and delete every other release
version (e.g. after raising the minimum supported version). SNAPSHOT versions are always kept:

```bash
uv run collector-watcher --backfill --versions "0.156.0,0.157.0" --prune-unlisted
```

`--prune-unlisted` requires both `--backfill` and `--versions`; running it without a version list
exits with an error rather than wiping the registry.

#### Options

- `--backfill` - Enable backfill mode (regenerates existing versions)
- `--distribution {core,contrib}` - Target a specific distribution
- `--versions VERSION_LIST` - Comma-separated list of versions (e.g., "0.144.0,0.145.0")
- `--prune-unlisted` - Delete existing release versions not in `--versions` before backfilling
  (SNAPSHOTs kept); requires `--backfill` and `--versions`
- `--inventory-dir PATH` - Custom path to inventory directory (default:
  ecosystem-registry/collector)

**Note:** Backfill mode will delete and regenerate the specified versions. The tool automatically
checks out the correct git tags for each version.

## Development

See the parent [ecosystem-automation README](../README.md) for setup and testing instructions.

### Running Tests

```bash
# From repository root
uv run pytest ecosystem-automation/collector-watcher/tests --cov=collector_watcher
```
